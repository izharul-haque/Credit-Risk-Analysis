# Credit-Risk-Analysis

# Problem Statement
Good applicants applied for loan are not rejected and to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default. 
To develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending 
to customers. As part of this study we need to perform below tasks:

- Data Understanidng,Cleansing and quality check.
- Univariate and Bi-variate analysis through graphical and statistical analysis.

# Business Objectives
To analyse the patterns in the data to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as 
denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the 
loan are not rejected.

In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. 
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

# Dataset Description
